## About Me
I am Soumi Das, a post-doctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), Saarbruecken advised by [Professor Krishna Gummadi](https://www.mpi-sws.org/people/gummadi/). Presently I'll be working on understanding the robust representations learnt by large foundation models. I have worked in my PhD tenure under the supervision of [Dr. Sourangshu Bhattacharya](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourangshu/index.html) in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering (C.S.E), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in) I joined [Complex NEtwork Research Group (CNeRG)](http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/) of this department in May, 2017. My research area during PhD broadly spans Machine Learning and Computer Vision and dealing with subset selection problems in the field of data-centric AI. 

## Education
I have completed my **B.Sc (Computer Science Honours)** from **St. Xaviers College** in 2014. Then I completed my **M.Sc (Computer Science)** from the **Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University (B.H.U)** in 2016. I submitted my PhD thesis entitled [**'Algorithms for online subset selection and data valuation in data-centric AI'**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x36ts2ku994seewa3e0e8/SoumiDas_17CS91P08_Thesis.pdf?rlkey=xdzkap675395j5oc7qflpii6g&st=p7lvlb5v&dl=0) at IIT Kharagpur in July 2023. A quick overview of the works can be viewed at this [projects page](https://sites.google.com/view/projectsubset/).
